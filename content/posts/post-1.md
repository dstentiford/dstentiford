"Doing Ethnography Remotely" is a video series I  edited and produced in the spring of 2020 for the Center for Global Ethnography. In the interviews, Sharika Thiranagama (Anthropology) and Sylvia Yanagisako (Anthropology) interview six ethnographers who have conducted research remotely. The conversations conclude with advice to grad students planning ethnographic research projects in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The series is viewable here:
